Random thoughts that came in my mind while I learnt ml theory. If reading from future, please research!

## Can we make a **math algorithm** to find the optimal learning rate of a model

## Can we give AI feelings

## What does the model think of how we teach it

## Can we take suggestions from our ml model on how it would like to learn
